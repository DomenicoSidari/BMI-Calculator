# Description
The attached code is a simple function to calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) of an individual.
The calculations are based on the standard BMI calculation of: 

"BMI = (Weight in Pounds x 703) / (Height in Inches x Height in Inches)"

Not to mention, the calculations are also based upon the standard BMI table to calculate a justified assessment of the BMI of an individual.  Said table can be seen below under the "Table" heading.
